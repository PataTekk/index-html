  <b>I'm very Ugly</b><br>
  <p>So don't try to convince me that<br><br>
  I am a very beautiful person<br><br>
  Because at the end of the day<br><br>
  I hate myself in every single way<br><br>
  And i am not going to lie to myself by saying<br><br>
  There is beauty inside of me that matters<br><br>
  So rest assured i will remind myself<br><br>
  That i am a worthless, terrible person<br><br>
  And nothing you say will make me believe<br><br>
  That i still deserve love<br><br>
  Because no matter what<br><br>
  I am not good enough to be loved<br><br>
  And i am in no position to believe that<br><br>
  Beauty does exist within me<br><br>
  Because whenever i look in the mirror i always think<br><br>
  Am I as Ugly as People Say?
